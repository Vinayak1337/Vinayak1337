- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vinayak1337

I am a web developer, pursued my Computer Engineering degree from Ambedkar Institute of Technology.
Working on computer & creating something new was my dream ever since when I was a child. And now I finally became one. I am a MERN-Stack Developer.

â€¢ My skills are: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, React Js, Redux, Next Js, Node Js, Express Js, Nest Js, MongoDB, Mongoose, PostgreSql, GIT & Github.

â€¢ I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript on all libraries & frameworks. But I have more experience in JavaScript (1.5 yrs) than TypeScript (8 months).

â€¢ I can create a full responsive single page application with react js, where I handle large states with redux & I also handle routing using react-router-dom so it can mimic as multi page application and still provide a single page application to maximize performance. I'm also familiar with react hooks & my most common used hooks are useState, useReducer, useRef, useEffect ( with useMemo or useCallback). I also create custom hooks. And I create my own backend server to handle authentication & make crud requests to my database. I am even familiar with firebase for all my backend work.

â€¢ I can create a RESTful API using Node Js & Express Js. Where I use webpack to bundle all my files into one single file. I use argon2 npm package to encrypt and decrypt passwords or sensitive information. And I use mongodb database to store all the info where I use mongoose library to handle all crud operations to my database. I am even familiar with multer & GridFs to receive and store images to the database and stream them to create an URL of the image.

â€¢ I can create a server side multi page website with the help of Node Js and Express Js. And I use webpack for bundling.

â€¢ I can also create multi page application in Next Js with Client Side & Server Side Rendered pages. And do all my crud operations to the database in the same app.

And I'm always excited to learn new things.
